# H-field & E-field EMI probes

## About us
This design has been made by the coil-lab of the High Field MRI Group of the UMC Utrecht in the Netherlands, where we make hardware to support our researchers. We are part of a research group which means we feel the need to open up some of our designs to whomever can make use of it, to further the research of MRI applications.


## The design
This project contains a collection of H-field and E-field EMI probes:
- E-field probe 5mm
- E-field probe 10mm
- H-field probe 4mm
- H-field probe 10mm
- H-field probe 22mm
- H-field probe 40mm
- H-field probe 60mm

The connector fits SMA/SMB/BNC type connectors.

The design and subsequent drawing has been done in Kicad 5.1.5.


## Download
Gerber files for the latest version of the PCB can be found in the 'Releases' page, or by following [this link](https://github.com/umcu7tcoillab/EMI-probes/releases/latest). 
You can also make your own production files by downloading the Kicad project and generating them.
